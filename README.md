# QtGamepad

Adds support for reading from Gamepad devices on Linux. Designed to be used when writing games with Qt5.

This module provides classes that can:
Read Linux input events from Gamepad devices (Button and Axis events)
Provide a queryable input state (by processing events)
Provide Keybindings

This has been tested with the USB Xbox controler.
